# About

I'm a software developer with industry experience building websites and web applications. Presently working as lead frontend developer for Remita Nigeria in the infrastructure and payments gateway business uni, my industry experience spans working on every Javascript framework from React and Vuejs (ERP solutions), Angular 2, Nodejs with Sails and Express, Grapqhl with Gatsby, and even HandleBars and Jquery on a daily basis! In essence, i specialize in JavaScript. I also have experience building UI/UX with Figma.

For DevOps, i use Docker and Redis. I've even had reason to dabble in Java SpringBoot application maintenance and scaling.
